# Anime Chrome Extension

Hey Everyone ðŸ‘‹, 

I have been watching anime for a very long time now and struggle to keep track of the shows I watch. This can often lead to me dropping/pausing some animes. For that reason, I made AnimeBuddy. AnimeBuddy will help keep track of all of your favourite shows even while telling you when the next episode will air. If you want to stay ontop of all your animes use this nifty extension!

## Technologies Used
